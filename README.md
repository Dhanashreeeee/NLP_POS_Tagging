Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging is a fundamental task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that involves labeling words in a text with their respective parts of speech, such as nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs. It plays a crucial role in various NLP applications, including syntactic parsing, sentiment analysis, and machine translation.

When working with Indian languages, POS tagging presents unique challenges due to rich morphology, free word order, and the presence of postpositions. To address these challenges, this project implements a POS tagging system for Indian languages along with parse tree generation, which provides a visual representation of the syntactic structure of a sentence.
